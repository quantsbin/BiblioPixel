# Aliases and Defaults

All this can amount to a lot of typing, so BiblioPixel gives you some shortcuts.

## Typename expansion.

If you are only specifying a `typename` for a component, then you don't have to specify the entire dictionary, just the name of the class.

This means that a project

    {"driver": {"typename": "bibliopixel.drivers.API.LPD8806.LPD8806"}}

is identical to the easier-to-read

    {"driver": "bibliopixel.drivers.API.LPD8806.LPD8806"}

### Aliases.
Aliases are just shorthand for some common classes.  It lets you write the project

    {"driver": "bibliopixel.drivers.API.LPD8806.LPD8806"}

as

    {"driver": "LPD8806"}

You can find a current list list of the aliases in [this file](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel/blob/master/bibliopixel/project/aliases.py).  

Aliases are case insensitive.

### Command-line flags.

There are three command line flags that are used to fill in missing components in your project file - `--driver`, `--layout`, and `--animation`.

You can either pass in an alias, or for more control, a JSON dictionary, which you will have to quote for your shell:

    bibliopixel --animation=matrix_test
    bibliopixel --layout='{"typename": "matrix", "width": 12, "height": 12}'

### The `--ledtype` command line flag.

The [[SPI]] and [[Serial]] drivers require an `"ledtype"` field to identify the hardware type of the LED - see [LED Types](Serial#led-types).  You can use the `--ledtype` flag to enter this value from the command line as either a string or an integer.
