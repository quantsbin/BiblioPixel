# The `shape` and `layout` sections.

## `shape`

`shape` specifies how many lights there are and how they are arranged.

If the lights are in a linear strip, `shape` is a single number:

    shape: 100

which means a strip of 100 lights.


If the lights are in a matrix, then `shape` is a width, height pair:

    shape: [32, 16]

which means a matrix that is 32 pixels wide and 16 pixels tall.


If the lights are in a cube, then `shape` is an x, y, z triple:

    shape: [2, 4, 8]

which means a cube that is 2 pixels wide, 4 pixels deep and 8 pixels high.


## The `layout` section

The `shape` section is good enough for a lot of simple layouts but
more complex layouts to be specified will need the `layout` section.

We have the following layout classes: [TODO: link to the autogenerated docs here]

* `strip`
* `matrix`
* `cube`
* `circle`
