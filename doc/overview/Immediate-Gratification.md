# Immediate gratification: flashing lights from one command line.

If you have Python 3 installed:

`sudo pip3 install bibliopixel && bp demo`

If you are using a
[virtualenv](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv),
which is recommended but not required for this and most Python projects,
you can just type:

`pip3 install bibliopixel && bp demo`

If you don't know if you have Python 3 installed, type `python3 --version` and
if that works, you're good to go

Otherwise, download and install Python3 from here:
