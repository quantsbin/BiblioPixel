Welcome to the BiblioPixel Light Programming System!
====================================================

BiblioPixel is a free and open-source Python program for real-time animation of
lights of all types, often strips of LEDS, which allows people to share
lighting animations they have created.

Features
========

BiblioPixel has some snappy features:

* It has drivers for almost every popular LED strip, and many other lights.

* Animations can be put together without any programming...

* ...but it's also easy to write your own animations, drivers and layouts.

* There's a high-performance WebGL visualizer

* ...and you can also make animated GIFs to send to your friends.

* BiblioPixel uses high-performance [``numpy``](http://www.numpy.org/)
  arithmetic...

* ...but interoperates nicely with plain old lists.

* There's event handling which can connect any control to any animation
  without programming.

* ...and many more

## This documentation

The documentation is divided into three parts:

1. **Overview**
2. **Topic articles**
3. **Reference**

The **Overview** contains:

* [Immediate Gratification](overview/Immediate-Gratification.md)
* [BiblioPixel Basics](overview/BiblioPixel-Basics.md)
* [How To Install BiblioPixel](overview/How-To-Install-BiblioPixel.md)
* [How to make a Project](overview/How-to-make-a-Project.md)
* [Parts of a Project](overview/Parts-of-a-Project.md)

how to install BiblioPixel and then has a high-level
explanation of how BiblioPixel works and what goes into a BiblioPixel project.

Then it drills down into the specific parts of a Project and how they are put
together.

Finally, there's an example of how to put a Project together from scratch.

**Topic Articles** are individual articles about specific topics:

* Troubleshooting a BiblioPixel project
* Using the `bp` command-line program
* How to write your own ``Animation`` class
* How to use ``numpy``
* How to use controls

The **Reference** section contains a glossary, and automatically-generated
API documentation.
