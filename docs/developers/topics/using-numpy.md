# Using `numpy` color lists

## Introduction

All BLiPS animation is accomplished by changing a _color list_ - a list of RGB
colors.

In all BLiPS versions up until and including v3, a color list was a Python list
of Python tuples.

We call this "classic Python lists". This was very convenient and easy to
understand - but classic lists are slow and uses a lot of memory if there are a
lot of colors, and even quite simple operations on classic lists require
many lines of code.

Enter `numpy`!

[`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) is a Python package that has purely numeric
arrays (lists and matrices) that use less memory and are a lot faster - but even
better, `numpy` also lets you express even quite complex numeric operations with
a smaller amount of clearer code than using classic lists.

Since BLiPS version 3.4.0, animations can use `numpy` arrays by setting the
Project section `"numbers"` to be `"float32"`.

Starting in BLiPS 4.0, `numpy` arrays will be the default, and fairly soon after
that, we'll be phasing out classic lists.


## What's a `numpy` color list like?

Whether it's `numpy` or "classic", a color list is just a list of RGB colors.

Almost all operations that work on a classic list work the same way on a `numpy`
list: for example:

```
    from bibliopixel.project.data_maker import ColorList, NumpyColorList
    from bibliopixel.util.colors import COLORS

    classic_list = ColorList(4)
    numpy_list = NumpyColorList(4)

    classic[0] = COLORS.yellow
    classic[1:4] = COLORS.red, COLORS.green, COLORS.blue

    numpy_list[0] = COLORS.yellow
    numpy_list[1:4] = COLORS.red, COLORS.green, COLORS.blue
```

sets the first four colors of a color list to yellow, red, green and blue.

Unlike classic lists, you can write over components in a color_list:

```
    numpy_list[0][0] = 0
    # classic_list[0][0] = 0    # Can't modify a tuple!  throws a TypeError.
```

Where `numpy` disinguishes itself is operations that apply to all the colors at
once.  To reduce the intensity of each color just created by 50%:

```
    for i, (r, g, b) in enumerate(classic):
        classic[i] = (r / 2, g / 2, b / 2)

     # Much easier:
     numpy_list /= 2

```

It works even better if you have multiple lists - you can do slick things like:
`numpy_list = (2 * list_1 + 3 * list_2) ** 2.5`


## Be careful:  references can be tricky

Unlike classic lists, if you extract a color from a `numpy` color list and then
modify it, the original list is also changed!

```
    numpy_list[:] = COLORS.red, COLORS.green, COLORS.blue

    color = numpy_list[0]

    # later
    color[0] = 0

    numpy_list[0]  # Now it's black!
```

## How to get your BiblioPixel Animation to use `numpy` lists.

You won't need to change anything in your Project at all, but if you have
written a custom Animation, you might need to change your code.

In our experience so far, 95% of existing Animations worked immediately with
`numpy` and all the rest required only tiny changes.

You can easily find out - just run your project with the command line float
`--numbers=float` like this:

```
    bp --numbers=float your-project-name.json
```

and send us the code for your Animation and the error!
